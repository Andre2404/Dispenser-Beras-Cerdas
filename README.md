# Dispenser-Beras-Cerdas
Project for microcontrollers, controls systems, and electric motor.

This prototype is designed to precisely measure rice input using an HX711 load cell sensor and ESP32 as its core microcontroller. To enhance safety, an infrared sensor is integrated to detect the presence of a container, preventing spills during the dispensing process. Beyond the LCD user interface, the system also supports web-based monitoring and control, enabling seamless interaction via devices connected to the same WiFi network.

Additionally, this technology has potential applications in automated pet feeding systems, allowing remote control and scheduling through ESP32 as the receiver and controller.
